Hi! 👋

I`m a full stack developer. Main technologies that I use are Laravel and React. I work with attention to detail to deliver and enhance features that I would be proud of. I strive to improve experiences of people using the web by understanding their needs and their habits. I take great pleasure working with new technologies, I make it my goal to improve myself and my skills. Always grateful for people that share their knowledge.

Personally, in addition to technology, I am also interested in the world around us. I like to learn new things, how they are created, what makes them possible. 
In my spare time I take to mechanics, aviation, also shooting sports as a hobby. 
I try not to be passive in things that affect me.
